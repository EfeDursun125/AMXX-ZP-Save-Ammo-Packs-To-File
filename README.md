# ZP Save Ammo Packs To File
This plugin saves ammopacks to file, use this if other banks not saving or banks has problems on your server
.ammo files can be read as text with notepad and can be changed

# IMPORTANT
1. Name/SteamID/IP based save system (Default is name)
2. IP values can be changed and they are not static, so i don't recommend to use it
3. Names can be changed to but you can use any register system to protect names
4. Cracked client's SteamID may be changed, so i recommend name based save system with register system
